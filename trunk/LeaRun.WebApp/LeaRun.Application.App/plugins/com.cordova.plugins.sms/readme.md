Cross-platform plugin for Cordova / PhoneGap to to easily send SMS. Available for **Android**, **iOS**, **Windows Phone 8** and **Windows 10 Universal (BETA)**.

##Using the plugin
HTML

    <input id="numberTxt" placeholder="Enter mobile number" value="" type="tel" />
    <textarea id="messageTxt" placeholder="Enter message"></textarea>
    <input type="button" onclick="app.sendSms()" value="Send SMS" />

Javascript

    var app = {
        sendSms: function() {
            var number = document.getElementById('numberTxt').value;
            var message = document.getElementById('messageTxt').value;
            console.log("number=" + number + ", message= " + message);
  
            //CONFIGURATION
            var options = {
                replaceLineBreaks: false, // true to replace \n by a new line, false by default
                android: {
                    intent: 'INTENT'  // send SMS with the native android SMS messaging
                    //intent: '' // send SMS without open any other app
                }
            };

            var success = function () { alert('Message sent successfully'); };
            var error = function (e) { alert('Message Failed:' + e); };
            sms.send(number, message, options, success, error);
        }
    };

On Android, an extra function is exposed to know whether or not you have the permission to send a SMS (Android Marshmallow permission).

    var app = {
        checkSMSPermission: function() {
            var success = function (hasPermission) { 
                if (hasPermission) {
                    sms.send(...);
                }
                else {
                    // show a helpful message to explain why you need to require the permission to send a SMS
                    // read http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html#explain for more best practices
                }
            };
            var error = function (e) { alert('Something went wrong:' + e); };
            sms.hasPermission(success, error);
        }
    };

    BUILD FAILED

The problem is that you need to make sure that you set the target to android-19 or later in your ./platforms/android/project.properties file like this:

    # Project target.
    target=android-19


##### How can I send an sms in my iOS app without passing control to the native app like it can be done on Android?

This isn't possible on iOS. It requires that you show the user the native sms composer, to be able to send an sms.

Contributing
============

I believe that everything is working, feel free to put in an issue or to fork and make pull requests if you want to add a new feature.

Things you can fix:
* Allow for null number to be passed in
  Right now, it breaks when a null value is passed in for a number, but it works if it's a blank string, and allows the user to pick the number
  It should automatically convert a  null value to an empty string

Thanks for considering contributing to this project.

### Finding something to do

Ask, or pick an issue and comment on it announcing your desire to work on it. Ideally wait until we assign it to you to minimize work duplication.

### Reporting an issue

- Search existing issues before raising a new one.

- Include as much detail as possible.

### Pull requests

- Make it clear in the issue tracker what you are working on, so that someone else doesn't duplicate the work.

- Use a feature branch, not master.

- Rebase your feature branch onto origin/master before raising the PR.

- Keep up to date with changes in master so your PR is easy to merge.

- Be descriptive in your PR message: what is it for, why is it needed, etc.

- Make sure the tests pass

- Squash related commits as much as possible.

### Coding style

- Try to match the existing indent style.
